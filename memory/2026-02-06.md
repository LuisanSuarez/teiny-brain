## PuenteSat Client Meeting
Had a meeting with a client who's excited about PuenteSat and finds it useful. They requested several features:

**Top Priority:**
- Viáticos (employee expense uploads) — group invoices by employee, single QB upload, Excel column concatenation

**Also requested:**
- Sales invoice upload (already planned)
- Multi-currency (GTQ/USD)
- Column freeze/reorder for horizontal scroll
- Remove invoices from batch
- Unblock repeated invoices (with confirmation)
- Detect void invoices (show in red, option to force $0 upload)

📹 **Recording available** — screenshots + video from the meeting for reference.

**Note:** UI naming for "employee" section still TBD.
