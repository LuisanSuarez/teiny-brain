- Planning preference clarified: for multi-pass strategy work, default to high-level overview first, then ask whether to deepen into executable plan. Do not assume full execution depth unless requested.
- Refined workflow preference for ambiguous “many runs” requests: ask first before starting, then synthesize, then go deep or refine based on answer. If goal of many passes is unclear, confirm intent up front (don’t wait until after completion).
- Praise/lesson learned: Luisan strongly liked the workflow of converting vague architecture goals into enforceable, easy-to-spot “Maxims” plus a repeatable Tao review loop. Keep doing: deep dive -> trace -> rewrite -> score -> rule extraction, then test on a real module before coding changes.
- Low-priority idea to build later in free time: a small “Tao of Life” app/web app to capture short maxims and review them (especially before bed).
