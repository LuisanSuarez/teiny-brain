- Planning preference clarified: for multi-pass strategy work, default to high-level overview first, then ask whether to deepen into executable plan. Do not assume full execution depth unless requested.
- Refined workflow preference for ambiguous “many runs” requests: ask first before starting, then synthesize, then go deep or refine based on answer. If goal of many passes is unclear, confirm intent up front (don’t wait until after completion).
