- Set default model primary to Anthropic Opus with fallbacks: gpt-5.2-codex → gpt-5.2-pro → gpt-5.2-chat-latest → Sonnet (config patched + gateway restarted).
- User wants fallback on 401/4xx; checked schema—no config flag for that yet.
- Created /Users/luisan/.openclaw/workspace/links.md with OpenClaw + major model provider docs.
- Brave Search API key added and verified working (rate-limited on free plan for multiple searches).
- OpenAI prompt caching docs confirm automatic caching for prompts ≥1024 tokens and optional prompt_cache_retention: "24h".
