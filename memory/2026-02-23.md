## Evening reflections with Luisan (playful ideation)
- Luisan wants Teiny in lean mode to reduce token burn when usage is low.
- Disabled non-essential daily automations: Evening Wrap-up + Recurrente Daily Check-in; kept Morning Briefing + soul-sync.
- Preference update: default style should be opinionated + challenging.
- Future idea: build a Teiny learning pipeline (books/articles) with quality filtering, redundancy checks, and compression into actionable heuristics.
- Potential budget concept: USD $100/month for learning materials; treat as ROI-driven allocation.
- Follow-up later (not tonight): propose a lightweight “Teiny operating manual” and a realistic 20% implementation of the personal-OS concept.
- Luisan asked to save a reading list for future purchase: $100M Offers, $100M Leads, The Mom Test, Obviously Awesome, Breakthrough Advertising, Influence, Alchemy, Lean Analytics.
- Luisan wants a future nudge that Teiny is "book hungry".
- Brainstorm continued: if scaling from $1k/mo to $10k/mo, focus on product ecosystem + repeatable distribution + positioning + systems.
- Luisan asked what infra/tools would make Teiny more powerful (self-hosted server, APIs, local models, multi-agent orchestration).
- Updated persona docs to keep a playful challenger style: opinionated + challenging by default, plus lightweight creative “Spark” ideas.
- Added preference for recurring fun ideation prompts (including “illegal-feeling-but-legal” style).
