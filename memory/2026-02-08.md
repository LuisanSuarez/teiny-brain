## Catch-Up After Downtime

Was down Friday (Feb 7) due to 401 API errors. Caught up with Luisan today.

## PuenteSat Updates (Fri-Sun)

Major progress over the weekend:

**Architecture Refactor:**
- Verb-noun file structure with separated controller routes
- Business logic moved into models
- Much cleaner codebase now

**Features Completed:**
- ✅ Bundled invoices (evolved from viáticos concept → now generic)
- ✅ Custom columns feature
- ✅ XLS file upload support
- ✅ Unlock repeated invoices (action button)
- ✅ Remove invoices from batch (action button)

## Tributax Updates

- Big refactor in progress
- Opus (Claude) is handling it
- Codebase is large, so it's taking time

## Tributax Payment Link

- Shipped fix Feb 6
- Verified Feb 8: **DID NOT WORK** 😅
- Need to fix after refactor completes
- **Monday reminder set** to run manual charge for customers

## PuenteSat Roadmap

- **Next week:** Sales invoice upload
- **Next weekend:** Multi-currency (GTQ/USD)
- **Note:** Void invoice detection only possible from XLS (not XML)
- **Done:** Column visibility fix

## PuenteSat Tech Debt (added evening)

1. **Backend processing too slow** — XML and XLS uploads take way too long
2. **PDF polling architecture sucks** — after submission, keeps spamming attachment requests to check upload status. Shipped to unblock but needs a real fix (websockets? webhooks? smarter polling?)

## Tributax Order of Operations

1. ⏳ Big codebase refactor (Opus handling it)
2. Fix payment link
3. Fix bank transfer links

## Patterns to Remember

- **Tributax refactor:** Check in on weekends about progress
