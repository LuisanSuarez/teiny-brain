## Context shared
Luisan walked me through their work situation:
- **Recurrente** — day job, payment ops developer, fraud/chargebacks. Busiest thing.
- **Tributax** — co-founder/CTO, accounting startup in Guatemala
- **Puentesat** — new passion project, SAT invoice parser → QuickBooks. Wants to grow this and eventually go full-time.

They want help organizing tasks and prioritizing across all three.

## Recurrente dump
Created `projects/recurrente/TASKS.md` with:
- **Critical bug:** Payments stuck in verification → double charges
- **Backlog:** Old PRs need Sandy Metz review
- **1-on-1 items** from Feb 2024 meeting with Alejo (CEO)
- Research tasks: Stripe/Adyen/Square practices for incentives & chargebacks
- Crypto risk engine improvements (liveness check, AI review)
- Open questions on priorities (revenue calc vs AI withdrawals vs crypto protection)

## Action items
- Set up a task/priority tracking system ✅ (built kanban board)
- Check in monthly about priorities across the three projects
- Help with chargeback state updates (Luisan mentioned Claude could help)
- Auto-void invoices in dev — Luisan wants to delegate this

## Kanban board
Built at `projects/kanban/index.html` - Trello-style board with:
- Two columns: Luisan & Teiny
- Up/down arrows for priority
- Left/right arrows to move between columns
- Data stored in localStorage + syncs to `kanban-data.json`

## Notes
- The 1-on-1 notes were from Feb **2024** - almost 2 years old! Some items may be stale.
- Luisan wants to give me Google Sheets access for chargeback data
- Chargeback states need a PR to save to database
