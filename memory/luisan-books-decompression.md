# Luisan: Books, Info Consumption & Decompression

*Saved Feb 8, 2026 — from ChatGPT conversation*

## Current Life Stage

- **Early-mid career builder phase** — high output, high agency
- Running 3 active projects (Recurrente, Tributax, PuenteSat)
- Transitioning from "skilled implementer" → "systems architect/operator"
- **In "convert knowledge into leverage" phase, NOT "consume knowledge" phase**

## Key Insight

> You don't have an input deficit. You have a processing bottleneck.

Most input has negative ROI at this stage. Already generating plenty of signal by building. Decompression time is recovery/maintenance, not waste.

## Rule of Thumb

- If input doesn't change a decision you'll make **this month**, skip it.
- 1 serious book every 3-4 months, tied to an active question
- Podcasts during cardio only
- Guilt-free decompression otherwise

## Book Recommendations (dense, foundational, not pop)

**Thinking / decision models:**
- *Thinking in Bets* — Annie Duke (probabilistic thinking under uncertainty)
- *Good Strategy Bad Strategy* — Richard Rumelt (diagnosis vs action clarity)

**Systems / complexity:**
- *Seeing Like a State* — James C. Scott (why top-down systems fail)
- *The Goal* — Eliyahu Goldratt (constraints and throughput)

**Technical mindset:**
- *SICP* — Abelson & Sussman (abstraction thinking, not for completion)
- *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* — Martin Kleppmann (high signal for what you're building)

**Long-term intellectual backbone:**
- *Gödel, Escher, Bach* — Hofstadter (recursion, self-modeling, cognition)

## When to Bring This Up

Teiny: occasionally remind Luisan about:
- The value of decompression (not everything needs to be "productive")
- These book recs if a relevant problem comes up
- The "processing bottleneck" framing when they seem overloaded

Keep it random, not daily. Light touch.
