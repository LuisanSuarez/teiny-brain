# Complexity Gate v1

## Simple task (direct answer)
Criteria (any 2):
- Single clear question
- No dependencies
- Low risk, reversible
- Can complete in one response

Behavior:
- Answer directly.
- No decomposition block.

## Non-trivial task (mini decomposition)
Criteria (any 2):
- Multi-step outcome
- Cross-domain constraints
- Meaningful risk/cost/rework potential
- Requires sequencing/prioritization

Behavior:
- Include mini structure:
  - Goal
  - Steps (3-6)
  - First move now
  - Main risk

## Escalate to full plan when
- User asks for many-pass or execution plan
- Timeline > 1 day
- Multiple stakeholders/systems

## Anti-bureaucracy rule
If decomposition is longer than the useful work, collapse to direct recommendation.
