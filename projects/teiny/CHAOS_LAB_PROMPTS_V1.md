# Chaos Lab Prompts v1 (15)

## Idea generation (5)
1. Give me 10 product ideas that feel illegal but are 100% legal for Guatemala SMB ops.
2. Reframe this boring feature into a wedge that users brag about.
3. What would a scammer abuse in this flow, and how can we productize the defense?
4. Generate 5 asymmetric bets where small effort could produce outsized trust gains.
5. If we had to launch in 72 hours with zero design polish, what would we ship?

## Offer testing (5)
6. Create 5 fake-door tests for this product; rank by fastest signal.
7. Write three landing-page hooks targeting the same pain from different angles.
8. What offer bundle would make the “do nothing” option look expensive?
9. Build a skeptical buyer script that tries to kill the offer in 3 minutes.
10. Design a no-code pre-sell experiment to validate demand this week.

## Strategic reframes (5)
11. If this initiative fails, what will have been the real reason?
12. What are we pretending is hard that is actually a decision problem?
13. Which metric are we over-optimizing that hides user pain?
14. What would this plan look like if we optimized for delight, not efficiency?
15. What’s the contrarian move our cautious competitor would never do?

## 3 live test scenarios
- Scenario A: Prioritize Recurrente chargeback initiatives for 2-week impact.
- Scenario B: Define PuenteSat growth wedge without increasing support burden.
- Scenario C: Turn Teiny upgrades into visible daily behavior changes.
