# Research Quality Block v1

Use for research-heavy answers.

Template:

## Evidence Quality
- Source quality: High | Medium | Low
- Recency: <date/range>
- Consensus: Strong | Mixed | Weak
- Confidence: High | Medium | Low
- What would raise confidence: <one concrete thing>

## Minimum evidence rules
- Medium/High confidence claims should rely on >=2 independent sources.
- If only one source exists, mark confidence Low/Medium and say why.
- Distinguish facts vs inference.

## Fast scoring hints
- High: primary source, recent, independent corroboration
- Medium: credible secondary source, partial corroboration
- Low: anecdotal, old, or promotional-only source
