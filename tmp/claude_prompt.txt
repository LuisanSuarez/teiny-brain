Implement the plan in PLAN.md on the current branch (inhouse-invoice).

The branch already has ~80% of the work done: InfileSettings model, TaxInvoice model, controllers, views, facades, and workers are all in place. What remains is:

1. Consolidate 4 separate migrations into 1 (none have run in production)
2. Wire TaxInvoice into Invoice's creation/void/retry flow (the core wiring — Invoice still calls Infile directly instead of going through TaxInvoice)
3. Create BackfillTaxInvoicesWorker for ~45K historical records
4. Clean up any remaining InvoicingActivation references
5. Run tests and fix failures

The plan has exact code snippets for every change. Follow it step by step. Run tests after each step to catch issues early.
